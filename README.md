# Interactive-Maps
Get your weather forecast ANYWHERE by touching on the maps

This app uses darkSky API and Google Maps to get you the weather of ANY place by tapping on the map.

# Important
This app uses DarkSky, google maps and google places so you should get your own keys at (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/) , (https://darksky.net/dev)
You'll notice an error once you open the project and this is because you need to go to Constants file and put in the keys you get from the urls above.
